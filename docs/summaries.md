# 1. Visual Perception

# 2. Bilinguals and visual perception

## Language experience changes audiovisual perception:

### <https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci8050085>

-   RQ: Do bilinguals attend more to visual cues? Therefore can they
    benefit from AV?
-   Methodology: 4 Conditions: Audio, no audio, visual, visual mismatch.
    Audio conditions they introduce “noise”- Noise is not defined on the
    paper. The video was first presented, then the 6 possible different
    options. All at the same time.
-   Findings: Bilinguals are more sensible than monolinguals to the
    Mcgurk effect. Bilinguals pay more attention to visual cue than
    monolinguals, even though the accuracy levels of everyone were
    comparable in the audio-only condition. In noise conditions
    bilinguals and monolinguals rely on visual cues.

## Violation of non-adjacent rule dependencies elicits greater attention to a talker’s mouth in 15-month-old infants

### DOI: 10.1111/infa.12489

-   RQ: AV infants perception.
-   Methodology: Invented language of children. Visible the entire head.
    woman over facilities the input. Not very real input
-   Findings: Children attended more to the talker’s mouth when exposed
    to ungrammatical than grammatical sequences

# 3. Resyllabification

## The acquisition of resyllabification in Spanish by English speakers (Scarpace thesis)

### Chapter 1: Introduction

English does not have such phenomena. Keeps parking (aspirated) vs keep
Sparking. However in fricative nasals this can happen See Mable and seem
able. N/S ideal to investigate contrast person/ number English speakers
need to suppress their tendency for consonant initial (with
glottalization) in order to process V-CV or VC-V Hualde and Pilar Prieto
(2014) Peninsular Spanish word-final /s/ is more likely to be voiced and
shorter duration that word-initial /s/ - HOWEVER- overlap might happen.
Needed for ambiguity. Resyllabification not taught in L2 class.

### Chapter 2: Production: English and Spanish

150ms or longer was considered a pause when analyzing the production
materials. Pitch contour analysis: males between 50 to 300 Hz and for
females between 50 and 400Hz. HUGE difference in production
(glottalization) between L2 and native speakers. Limitation:
English-Spanish stimuli was produced by the same speakers & participant
number.

### Chapter 3: Perception

3 experiments: A: word-monitoring task investigating /n/ and /s/ at the
word boundary Native speakers perceive /n/ word initial 48% and /s/ 63%.
Native also could not perceive durational cues of /s/ B: Word-monitoring
task investigating /r/ C: Eye- tracking investigating whether multiple
lexical candidates are considered while listening to phrases where /n/,
/s/, and /r/ straddle the word boundary.

### Chapter 4: Eye tracking

• Traditional theoretical models (that segment consonants at the
beginning of the word) the Possible Word Constraint (Norris et al.,
1997) the Syllable Onset Segmentation Heuristic (Dumay et al., 200) ESL
– consonant-to-vowel linking (internal open juncture)

-   RQ: How do second language learners produce and recognize words in
    continuous speech when speech segmentation strategies differ between
    languages?

-   Findings: Results show that second language learners struggle
    overall to resyllabify consonants: they favor marking vowel-initial
    words with glottal stops, although they do so less than they do in
    English.

# 4. Bilinguals operate two langauges at the same time

## The dynamics of spoken word recognition in bilinguals

### <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728922000049>

-   RQ: Do bilinguals activate both languages? Do they separate language
    in specific lexical representations? (L1/L2) How top-down
    expectations influence and interact with subsequent bottom-up
    processing.
-   Methodology: ERPs with picture matching. Participants had to see a
    picture and listen. Phonetic negative mapping activates when
    processing neighboring words.

-Findings: Bilinguals activate both languages when performing a task in
L1. Both languages are always activated. Top-down cross-language
connections exist.

# 5. Cue weighting
